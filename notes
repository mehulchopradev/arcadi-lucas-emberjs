- Data (Resource) coming from the backend server service ---- Visualize in ember data as a `model`
- Attributes of the data (resource) --- Visualize as properties to be declared in the ember data model class


Application            Store            RESTAdapter                                                 Server

1. Application wants to GET the books data from the server and the Store does not have it
    a. Application will ask ember data Store for the `book` model records
    b. Store will return a Promise to the Application
    c. Store will ask the Adapter to get the data from the server
    d. Adapter wil return a Promise to the Store
    e. Adapter will make an XHR request to the server for the books data ------- GET -> /books
    f. Server responds back with a JSON array of JSON objects to the Adapter
    g. Adapter will resolve the promise given in step d to the Store, with the JSON array of JSON objects data
    i. Store will convert the JSON array of JSON objects data to a list of `book` ember data model records
    j. Store will resolve the promise given in step b to the Application, with the `book` model records

2. After the 1st scenario has happened, some other part of the application wants to GET the books data from the server
    a. Application will ask ember data Store for the `book` model records
    b. Store will return a Promise and immediately resolve the promise with the `book` data model records to the Application
    c. Store will ask the Adapter to get the data from the server
    d. Adapter wil return a Promise to the Store
    e. Adapter will make an XHR request to the server for the books data ------- GET -> /books
    f. Server responds back with a JSON array of JSON objects to the Adapter
    g. Adapter will resolve the promise given in step d to the Store, with the JSON array of JSON objects data
    i. Store will convert the JSON array of JSON objects data to a list of `book` ember data model records updating
    its existing ember data model records
    j. Application sees the changes done as part of step i because ember data model records have a binding with the view
